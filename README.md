# Camera access

For local development - most browsers don't allow access to camera through `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` in unsecure context.
You can bypass this through either testing on `localhost` or setting your dev server ip address as secure in unsafe chrome flags.

# Database

I use Planetscale which doesn't use foreign keys - so migrations will log errors BUT according to Planetscale it will still work fine, it's just that these constraints won't be applied.

# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.
